		<h4>Lesson:</h4>
		The easiest and most common thing to test controllers for is the $scope. Using $scope avoids using the DOM (Document Object Model - the view/html) all together, making things easier to test and less brittle if the HTML/CSS change later. This is great advantage of Angular (it was built with testing in mind)!

		<h4>Challenges:</h4>
		1. Run the tests to confirm them fail (we always want to ensure a failure first so we know when they pass later that actually means they are valid).<br />
		2. Make the tests pass then run them again to confirm they pass!
