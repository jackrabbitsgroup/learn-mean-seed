		The web debugger, also known as 'developer tools' or 'web inspector', is a ridiculously useful tool that no web coder should be without.
		It allows you to see error messages, view (and edit!) a page's rendered html and CSS, step-through debug Javascript, and more.
		<br/><br/>
		Debuggers vary a bit from browser to browser, but the concept and basic structure is the same.
		Chrome, Safari, and Firefox come with a debugger pre-installed and ready-to-use,
		and even Internet Explorer has one, though it's weak in comparison.
		I, however, highly recommend Firebug, a downloadable plugin for debugging in Firefox, but that may be just a matter of personal preference.
		<br/><br/>
		To activate the debugger (in most browsers), simply bring up the context menu (that means right-clicking the page, for Windows users),
		and select 'Inspect Element'. This will open a new panel on your screen,
		giving you access to a wide range of information organized across several tabs. Go ahead and try it now, on this page.
		The tabs you care most about are 'Console', 'Elements' (called 'HTML' in Firebug, 'Inspector' in Firefox's default), and 'Scripts' ('Debugger' in Firefox's default).
		<br/><br/>
		You'll start on the 'Elements' tab, where you can see all of the page's rendered HTML.
		Clicking on one of the elements in this tab will select it, allowing you to see additional information about it in the panel on the right.
		(The element you right-clicked when opening the web debugger will be selected initially).
		<br/><br/>
		Familiarize yourself with these panels, because they are a CSS writer's absolute best friend.
		Not only can you quickly view all CSS rules and styles being applied to the selected element, but you can <i>edit</i> them, too!
		This allows you to preview any CSS changes you may be considering, and see their effects without even touching your <code>.less</code> (or <code>.scss</code>) files.
		You can tweak your styles in the browser window to your heart's content and then, once satisfied with the result, mirror your changes in your files.
		This is about a thousand times faster than editing your files, saving, running <code>grunt</code>, and then reloading the page to see your adjustments.
		And if you make a terrible mistake in the debugger, no problem! You can always simply reload the page, and you'll be back to where you started.
		<br/><br/>
		The 'Console' tab is where you go to view error messages as well as any and all data that has been logged with Javascript's <code>console.log()</code>.
		(If you haven't learned anything about Javascript yet, feel free to come back to this later.)
		You should find some such data there now; if not, just refresh the page while the debugger is active.
		This is the first place to go if you think your page is broken or not responding - check for error messages!
		Sometimes the error messages aren't very helpful, but other times they'll tell you exactly what went wrong and where.
		<br/><br/>
		The 'Scripts' tab is where you go to debug your Javascript, using breakpoints, Step Overs, Step Intos, etc.
		- coders experienced with other languages will probably be right at home here.
		For the rest of you, know that this tab will allow you go through your Javascript code one line at a time.
		Simply click a line to insert a breakpoint; when the code reaches that line, it will pause,
		allowing you to inspect variable values and such at that point in time.
		From there, you can use the various 'Step' buttons in the top right to walk through your code piece by piece.
		Needless to say, this is ideal for pinpointing errors and other bugs.
		<br/><br/>
		Here are some divs for you to play around with in the 'Elements' tab.
		<br/><br/>
		<div class = 'web-debugger-example1'>
			Try editing my width, and give me some <code>padding</code>!<br/>
			Most debuggers will let you highlight a CSS property's value and then cycle through possible values with the arrow keys.
		</div>
		<br/>
		<div class = 'web-debugger-example2'>
			That arrow-key trick works with colors, too! Try it on my background color.
