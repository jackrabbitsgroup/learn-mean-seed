		(Automatic) testing is one of the most important parts of writing high quality code. While it does require more time and effort to write and maintain tests, in the long term it almost always SAVES TIME (and money) by making the Quality Assurance phase much shorter, preventing regressions as code is changed/updated and more.

		One of the hardest parts about testing is terminology as it varies widely.
		<div class='margin-l'>
			<div>Code can be tested (and categorized) at multiple levels but we'll primarily use "unit" (small) tests and "end-to-end (E2E)" (large) tests.</div>
			<div>Similarly, there are many test tools and languages; we'll focus on Jasmine and Protractor with Karma as a frontend test runner and Istanbul for Code Coverage.</div>
			<div>Behavior Driven Development (BDD) is basically just Test Driven Development (TDD) "done right"</div>
		</div>
