		A function is a set of lines of code. A function can be made to do just about anything,
		but most coders will create a function to perform a specific, isolated task.
		Functions can accept inputs and can return a value, but need not do either.
		Functions are extremely useful for purposes of <b>abstraction</b>, <b>modularization<b/>, and reusability.
		<br/><br/>
		Abstraction (where functions are concerned) is akin to the idea of a function as a "black box".
		You know that if you give it some particular input, you'll get some particular output, and so long as it works,
		you do not care nor do you need to know how it does so.
		In this way, a well-written function can save you and others from worrying about sticky details:
		create a function that performs some complex task and verify that it works,
		and from then on you can just use that function for that task.
		You don't have to re-solve the complex problem every time, and anyone else using your function never needs to solve it at all.
		<br/><br/>
		Modularization is the concept of isolating pieces of code that perform a task independent of the surrounding code.
		This can aid with both organization and abstraction; rather than put all of your code in one big row of lines,
		you can break it up into several tasks with a function for each task, and then simply call the functions in sequence.
		Even if the functions are only called once, this can still be very helpful for keeping everything organized.
		If you discover a bug in one of the tasks, for example, you know exactly what function to start looking in,
		and anyone else using your code will have an easier time of it as well.
		<br/><br/>
		Reusability simply refers to the fact that you can call a function as many times as you like.
		If you find yourself running the same 5 lines of code again and again in a bunch of places,
		try wrapping it in a function and using that instead.
		Not only does this slim down your code and save you time,
		but it also allows you to change those 5 lines everywhere at once, should you ever need to.
