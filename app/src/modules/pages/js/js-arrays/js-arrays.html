		Arrays are a useful way of storing data, and should be familiar to experienced coders.
		An array is a list of 'elements' (pieces of data), in some order.
		Each element has a specific index in the array; the first element is at index 0.
		Elements in an array can be of any data type - number, string, function, object, array, etc.
		<br/><br/>
		Arrays in Javascript are really just a special type of <a ng-href = '{{appPathLink + "js-objects"}}'>object</a> that Javascript provides native support for,
		which is why the syntax is so similar.
		You don't need to worry about this relationship too much, though, since Javascript handles those details for you.
		<br/><br/>
		Javascript provides several methods for dealing with arrays.
		You can find the full list at <a href ='http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_array.asp'>W3Schools</a>.
		The most commonly used (and therefore important to know) methods are <code>indexOf</code>, <code>push</code>, <code>sort</code>, and <code>splice</code>.
