		HTML and CSS can put elements on a webpage for the user to see, but Javascript is what lets a page <i>do</i> something.
		Javascript is what handles all the behind-the-scenes logic of a webpage;
		it's where you put your functions and variables, handle data, interface with the server, etc.
		People with prior coding experience will probably feel right at home with Javascript's syntax and structure.
		<br/><br/>
		In Angular, your Javascript code will typically be placed in a Controller, Service, or Directive.
		You won't need to worry much about writing services or directives for a while, though, so we'll focus on controllers for now.
		<br/><br/>
		A controller is a Javascript function that governs a block of HTML, designated using <code>ng-controller</code>.
		In Mean Seed, every page has its own controller, and each of these controllers is its own file.
		You can easily tell that a file holds a controller because its name will end in <code>Ctrl.js</code>.
		<br/><br/>
		The importance of Javascript scales with the complexity of the webpage.
		A simple page like this one, which just needs to display "static" content (meaning nothing changes in response to user inputs),
		doesn't require any Javascript at all.
		Pages that aim to interact with a user, though, will tend to require more and more behind-the-scenes logic, and that's where Javascript shines.
		<br/><br/>
		Here's a simple example of some basic Javascript in action (in conjuction with Angular).
		Be sure to look at this page's controller file!
		Don't worry too much about how it works, though. We'll cover all of that in future lessons.
