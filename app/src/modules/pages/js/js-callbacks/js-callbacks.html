		Typically, when you write code in Javascript,
		you expect those lines of code to be executed in order, one after the other,
		with future lines waiting for previous ones to complete before executing.
		This is 'synchronous' behavior, and it's usually what happens.
		<br/><br/>
		However, you will occasionally encounter operations that do not follow this pattern.
		Queries to the server or to some another external source, for example,
		will tend to take far longer than internalized operations because they must communicate with a completely different computer and wait for that computer's response.
		In such cases, Javascript by default does not just twiddle its thumbs while waiting for a response
		(many websites would take much, much longer to load if it did!).
		Instead, it goes ahead and executes the rest of the code.
		<br/><br/>
		This kind of behavior is called 'asynchronous'.
		Though more efficient, asynchronous code requires some method of handling the results -
		we need some way to specify what to do next after the response is made.
		Callback functions are a simple, common way to do just that.
		<br/><br/>
		In a callback system, the function (possibly asynchronous) being executed takes a function as one of its inputs, known as the callback function.
		When the first function is done with its computations, it calls the callback function, as opposed to <code>return</code>ing some data.
		Thus, we can put code in the callback function and be sure that that code will not run until after the first function completes.

		See this page's Ctrl file for examples.

		<h4> Challenges: </h4>
		1. Write a function that takes two numbers, does some mathematical operation of your choosing, and uses a callback system to return the data.
		Invoke your function, and <code>console.log</code> your result from within your callback.
		Your function need not be asynchronous.
		<br/>
		(Callbacks are typically not used with synchronous functions because there is no need - a simple <code>return</code> would suffice in such cases -
		but they still work.)
