		Promises are a programming technique for handling asynchronous code blocks;
		they perform much the same function as <a ng-href = '{{appPathLink + "js-callbacks"}}' target = '_blank'>callbacks</a> in this regard.
		<br/><br/>
		Using promises tends to be a bit more flexible and syntactically simpler than using callbacks,
		but they're more complicated to understand.
		In Mean Seed, we use a library called <a ng-href = 'https://github.com/kriskowal/q' target = '_blank'>Q</a> to do most of the heavy lifting for us.
		Nevertheless, promises will still seem more difficult than callbacks at first,
		because you still need to learn how to use Q's promise structure
		(as compared to callbacks, where a basic understanding of functions is all you need to put everything together on your own).
		Once you learn how to use Q's promises, though, you'll probably find them more convenient than callbacks for many situations.
		<br/><br/>
		The basic concept behind a promise to have your function return not a result, but a promise to return a result at a later time.
		You may then specify functions to execute when the promise does return
		(typically, you'll have a function to handle successful computations and a function to handle failures or errors).
		Then, you make the function that returned the promise 'resolve' upon successful completion, or 'reject' upon failure,
		and Q directs the code to execute your success function or failure function as appropriate.		
		<br/><br/>
		That's really all there is to basic promises; the rest is just syntax.
		See this page's Ctrl file for examples.

		<h4> Challenges: </h4>
		1. In the Ctrl file, create your own call to <code>example_promise_function</code>, and write your own success and failure functions.
		Make your call result in your failure function being executed. Use <code>console.log</code> to check your work.
