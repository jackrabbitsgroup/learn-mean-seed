		Objects are a core part of javascript, which some of you might like to think of as associative arrays.
		Objects have 'properties' (keys), and each property has a value.
		There is no limit to the number of properties that an object can have, and each property's value can be anything -
		string, number, function, boolean, even another object - which makes objects a very flexible method of storing data.
