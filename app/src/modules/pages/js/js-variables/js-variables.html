		Variables are one of the most basic parts of javascript. They are used to store data.
		They should be declared before being used (though browsers usually aren't very strict about enforcing this rule), as in
		<br/><br/>
		<code> var my_variable; </code>
		<br/><br/>
		In this example, a variable named <code>my_variable</code> is created; <code>var</code> is a Javascript keyword for creating variables.
		The value of <code>my_variable</code> is currently <code>undefined</code> (which is a special value in javascript).
		We can now assign it any value we like, and re-assign it to another value at any time.
		Variables in Javascript are not bound by data type; any variable can store any type of data at any time,
		be it a number, a string, an array, an object, or even a function!
		(That's right - functions are data in javascript, so you can pass them around as function inputs or what-have-you, like any other piece of data).
		<br/><br/>
		Variable assignments in javascript are made using the syntax <code>variable = expression;</code>, which should be familiar to experienced coders.
		The value to the left of the <code>=</code> sign is always the name of the variable that you want to make an assignment to.
		The value to the right is some javascript expression; this expression will be evaluated, and then the result will be stored in the variable,
		overwriting any value currently in the variable.
		<br/><br/>
		Variable names (and also function names) in javascript <b>must</b> begin with $, _, or a letter. They may contain numbers, letters, and $ or _.
		They may NOT contain other symbols, notably spaces and -.
		(You might want to use hyphens in your variable names, but the browser would mistake this for subtraction.)
		Variable names are case-sensitive and can be any length. They cannot be the same as one of Javascript's reserved words.
		<br/><br/>
		Though the browser does not care what you name your variables (so long as you follow the rules above), humans do.
		Try to name your variables intelligently, so that you and others know what each variable is for, but also try to keep the name from being ridiculously long.
		<br/><br/>
		In Mean Seed, we tend to use the convention of naming variables with underscores as word separators
		(as in <code>my_variable</code>, not <code>myvariable</code> or <code>myVariable</code>)
		and naming functions in camelCase (as in <code>myFunction</code>, not <code>my_function</code>),
		though these are not strict rules by any means.
