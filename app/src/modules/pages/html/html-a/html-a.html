		The <code>a</code> element, short for 'anchor', is used to create links to other pages. Its most important attribute is <code>href</code>, which tells the tag where to link to.
		<br/><br/>
		
		<a href = 'http://angularjs.org/'> This is a link to the AngularJS home page. </a>
		
		<br/></br>
		The anchor tag creates a clickable block on the page; clicking that block directs the browser to the URL specified by the <code>href</code>.
		Anchors can contain more than just text, too - in fact, you can put just about anything inside of one.
		The image below is wrapped in an anchor tag that points to Google's home page.<br/>
		<a href = 'https://www.google.com/'>
			<img ng-src = '{{appPathImg + "ie-chrome-logo.png"}}' height = '60' width = '60'/>
		</a>
		<br/><br/>
		The <code>a</code> element also has a <code>target</code> attribute, which specifies where to open the link.
		Setting <code>target = '_blank'</code> is the most common, and will cause the link to open in a new tab.
		<br/><br/>
		<a href = 'http://angularjs.org/' target = '_blank'> This is a link to the AngularJS home page. It will open in a new tab, so clicking here won't make you leave this page. </a>
		<br/><br/>
		In Angular, we often use <code>ng-href</code> instead of <code>href</code>, because this allows us to safely use Angular variables in our links.
		This is particularly useful for creating links to other pages on your own website,
		and in Mean Seed we have a variable defined for you called <code>appPathLink</code> for precisely this purpose. Observe:
		<br/><br/>
		
		<a ng-href = '{{appPathLink + "html-div"}}' target = '_blank'> This is a link to this site's lesson on the <code>div</code> element. <code>appPathLink</code> takes care of the annoying beginning part of the link, so I only have to add the part that comes after the <code>/</code> in the url; in this case, <code>html-div</code>.</a>
		
		<br/><br/>
		<code>ng-href</code> can do everything <code>href</code> can do, so if you're working in Angular there's no reason not to use it.
