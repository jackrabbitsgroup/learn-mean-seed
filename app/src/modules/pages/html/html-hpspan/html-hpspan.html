		The <code>h</code> (heading), <code>p</code> (paragraph), and <code>span</code> elements are are used almost exclusively for placing text on the page.
		They are typically not used very often, though, because there is nothing that a heading, paragraph, or span can do that a well-styled <code>div</code> cannot.
		Neverthless, it is good to know that these elements exist.
		<br/><br/>
		Headings are fairly simple and come in 6 types, <code>h1</code> through <code>h6</code>. They are intended for creating single lines of large text:
		<br/>
		<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
		<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
		<h3>This is heading 3</h3>
		<h4>This is heading 4</h4>
		<h5>This is heading 5</h5>
		<h6>This is heading 6</h6>
		<br/>
		If a heading's size and styling is suitable for your needs, then headings are a very quick and easy way to place header text on a page.
		If not, then you're probably better off creating a div and styling it yourself instead.
		<br/><br/>
		Paragraphs do exactly what you'd expect - they place a block of text on the page, starting on a new line:
		<p> Here's a paragraph. </p>
		<br/>
		<p> Here's another paragraph. As with headings, paragraphs can be a very efficient way to place text if their default styling works for you,
		but otherwise you might as well use a div. (Here's some more filler text, just to make sure this paragraph fills multiple lines.)</p>
		<br/>
		Spans are usually much more useful than headings and paragraphs, because they can allow you to apply different styles to particular words in a block of text
		without interrupting the flow of the text. Though a div <span class = 'span-example1'>COULD</span> be used for this sort of thing, spans are much easier.
		Simply put the <span class = 'span-example2'>text you want to target</span> in a span, give it a class, and write some CSS for that class.
		<br/><br/>
		Spans can be thought of, to some extent, as an inline div (meaning they do not start on a new line, and do not take up more width than necessary).
		But though spans could be used for more than simply styling bits of text in a sentence, we do not recommend it.
		Spans do not always respond to styling like divs do, and can quickly become more trouble than they're worth in such cases.
		They're perfect for targeting pieces of text blocks, but I caution against trying to use them for much more than that. Try a <code>div</code> instead.
