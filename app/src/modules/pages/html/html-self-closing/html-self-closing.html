		You should know by now that most html elements have an opening tag (like <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>) and a closing tag (<code>&lt;/div&gt;</code>),
		which mark the start and end of the element, respectively. Some elements, however, do not follow this rule. They are called <i>self-closing</i>.
		<br/><br/>
		A self-closing element does not have a closing tag; instead, the opening tag closes itself, ending with <code>/&gt;</code>. Here is an example:
		<br/><br/>
		<code> &lt;br /&gt; </code>
		<br/><br/>
		It is impossible to nest any other text or html inside of a self-closing element, because self-closing elements do not have an inside.
		They may have attributes defined in the opening tag just like other html elements, but there is no closing tag, and therefore no space to put anything inside the element.
		<br/><br/>
		Here is a quick list of self-closing elements that you should be aware of, along with a brief description of each:
		<br/><br/>
		<a ng-href = '{{appPathLink + "html-br"}}'><code> &lt;br /&gt; </code></a> Puts a blank line on the page, like a newline character.<br/>
		<a ng-href = '{{appPathLink + "html-img"}}'><code> &lt;img src = 'path/to/image.jpg' /&gt; </code></a> Displays an image on the page.<br/>
		<a ng-href = '{{appPathLink + "html-input"}}'><code> &lt;input type = 'text' /&gt; </code></a> Creates an input where a user can type or interact, like for a login form.
		<br/><br/>
		There are other self-closing elements, but you'll rarely, if ever, have to deal with them.
