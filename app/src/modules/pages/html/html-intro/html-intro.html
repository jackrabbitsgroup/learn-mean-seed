		HTML is the most basic of all Web languages; it defines the page itself. It is possible to create a webpage that has no Javascript or CSS, but if a page has no HTML, it does not exist.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		HTML is composed of things called elements. Each element begins with an opening tag and ends with a closing tag.
		(There are a few elements, known as self-closing elements, that are exceptions to this rule; we'll cover them later.)
		<br/>
		An opening tag begins with a &lt; followed by the element name, and ends with &gt;. A closing tag begins with &lt;&#47;, followed by the element name and ending with &gt;.
		Anything between the element's opening tag and ending tag is said to be inside the element.
		<br/><br/>
		Example: Say we wanted to create a "div" element containing the text 'Hello World!'. We could do this using the following code:<br/><br/>
		<code>&lt;div&gt; Hello World! &lt;/div&gt;</code><br/><br/>
		Elements may contain more than just text, of course - they can contain other elements, too. In this case, the container element is often called the 'parent' element, while the
		contained element is known as the 'child'. There is no limit to the number of child elements that a parent may have; child elements of the same immediate parent are known as 'siblings'.
		I say 'immediate parent' here because, as you have probably guessed, elements may be nested without limit.
		That means that we could place a 'div' element inside of another div inside of a 'form' element inside of another div, and so on.
		<br/><br/>
		
		Important side note: Elements must be completely inside of their parent. It is illegal to place an element half-in, half-out of another. For example:
		<br/>
		<code>
			&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt; This is bad. The closing 'p' tag should come before the closing 'div' tag. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/p&gt;<br/>
			&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt; This is correct. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
		</code>
		<br/><br/>
		There are a wide variety of HTML elements, and they all behave a little bit differently. But every one of them is used to put some object on a webpage, be it a box with text, a link to another webpage, an image, or simply a blank line.
		We'll learn more about these various elements and what we can do with them in future lessons.
