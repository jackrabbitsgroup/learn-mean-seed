		The <code>br</code> element, short for 'break', as in 'line break', is probably the simplest of all html elements.
		It moves you to the next line of the page, as if you typed the 'Enter' key in a word processor - no more, no less.
		<br/><br/>
		This can be very convenient in html, especially when typing lots of text.
		Two <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code> tags were used on this very page to create the blank line above this piece of text.
		<br/><br/>
		We use this element because browsers condense continuous white space in an HTML file down to a single space when they render the page,
		which means that newlines and tabs are completely ignored.
		We coders are actually very glad of this fact, since it means we can safely format our files using as many tabs or blank lines as we want.
		This allows us to keep our code readable without worrying about messing up our webpage.
		<br/><br/>
		And so we have the <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code> element, then, to tell the browser that we actually want it to go to the next line.
		That's all there is to it.
		<br/><br/>
		Break tags are most commonly used between blocks of text, but they work just as well between divs or other html elements. However,
		you'll more likely use CSS margin or padding as a separator in those cases.
		<br/><br/>
		Note that this element is <a ng-href = '{{appPathLink + "html-self-closing"}}'><i>self-closing</i></a>.
