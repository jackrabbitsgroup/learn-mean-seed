		In Angular, it is not uncommon to have to communicate between controllers as users navigate your app and perform various actions.
		To this end, Angular allows you to create your own event listeners and trigger them whenever you like.
		The relevant methods are <code>$scope.$on</code>, <code>$scope.$broadcast</code>, and <code>$scope.$emit</code>.
		<br/><br/>
		<code>$scope.$on</code> creates an event listener.
		You give it a string (an 'event name') to watch for and a function.
		When the specified event name is triggered, the given function is executed.
		<br/><br/>
		<code>$scope.$broadcast</code> and <code>$scope.$emit</code> trigger an event.
		You give them an event name and a parameters object, and listeners for that event (created by <code>$scope.$on</code>) are triggered.
		The listeners' functions will be executed, and will receive the parameters object as input.
		<br/><br/>
		The only difference between <code>$scope.$broadcast</code> and <code>$scope.$emit</code> is the direction in which the message is sent.
		<code>$scope.$broadcast</code> targets event listeners defined in any child controllers as well as the current controller.
		<code>$scope.$emit</code> targets event listeners defined in any parent controllers as well as the current controller.
		<br/><br/>
		In this way, you can use event listeners to pass data between controllers or trigger actions defined in other controllers,
		effectively overcoming the potential shortcomings of <a ng-href = '{{appPathLink + "ang-scope-inheritance"}}' target = '_blank'>Scope Inheritance</a>.
		<br/><br/>
		Side note: <code>$scope.$broadcast</code> and <code>$scope.$emit</code> target only direct ancestor or descendent controllers,
		which means they cannot, for example, trigger events defined in sibling controllers.
		You can get around this sort of problem by emitting an event to their nearest common ancestor and then broadcasting back down,
		but it's usually easier to just use <code>$rootScope.$broadcast</code>.<br/>
		<code>$rootScope</code> is a service that you can inject into your controller (just like <code>$scope</code>),
		and it represents the app's top-level controller's <code>$scope</code>.
		Since every other controller in the app is a descendant of this controller,
		<code>$rootScope.$broadcast</code> can trigger events anywhere.

		<h4>Challenges</h4>
		1. Some examples have been set up for you in the sandbox.
		Once you understand them, fill in the <code>sandboxFunction</code> (which is activated via the button labeled 'Sandbox Button')
		and create any necessary events so that clicking the button adds both children's counters to the parent counter at once.
		<br/>(Optional bonus: solve this problem by creating no more than one new event trigger and no more than one new event listener.)
