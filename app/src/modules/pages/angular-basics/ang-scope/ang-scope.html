		Scope is easily the most useful feature that Angular has to offer.
		It bridges the gap between HTML and Javascript, allowing you to reference Javascript variables directly from HTML.
		Here's an example. Be sure to check both the HTML and Ctrl file for this page:
		<br/><br/>
		{{text}}
		<!--
			The double curly brackets tell Angular to treat the code inside as Javascript.
			Inside these brackets, you have access to any values you've attached to the $scope.
			In the example above, we simply reference a single variable, 'text', so it just displays the value of the controller's '$scope.text'.
		-->
		<br/><br/>
		<code>$scope</code> is really just a special Javascript object created by Angular,
		and what we call <code>$scope</code> variables are just properties that we attach to that object.
		<br/><br/>
		The data binding for <code>$scope</code> variables works two ways and updates automatically.
		That means that if a <code>$scope</code> variable's value changes in the Javascript controller,
		that change will be reflected in the HTML immediately.
		It also means that if you change the variable from the HTML, the Javascript <code>$scope</code> variable's value will immediately change as well.
		Here are some examples:
		<br/><br/>
		<div class = 'ang-scope-example1 {{example1.class_name}}' ng-click = 'toggleExample1()'> Click me to change my background color to {{example1.text}} </div>
		<br/>
		<div class = 'ang-scope-example2' ng-click = 'click_count = click_count + 1'> Click Me!<br/>{{"Clicked " + click_count + " times!"}}</div>
		<br/>
		As you may or may not realize, this two-way auto-update binding is <b><i>ridiculously</i></b> useful.
		Traditionally, updating HTML via Javascript isn't so simple; it can become extremely tedious and annoying.
		Angular, however, makes it trivially easy.
		<br/><br/>
		<code>$scope</code> is local to its controller.
		You cannot access a <code>$scope</code> variable from HTML outside of the controller's div - that's the div with <code>ng-controller='InsertNameHereCtrl'</code> on it.
		HTML inside of this div is said to be 'in the scope of the controller'.

		1. A button has been made for you in the sandbox. Clicking it will execute an empty function in the controller.
		There is also a blank div in the sandbox. Using <code>$scope</code> variables, fill in this function and this div so that the div is blank before the button is clicked,
		but gets a background color, border, and text of your choosing after the button is clicked. You may create any CSS rules you deem necessary.
