		Angular allows you to attach controllers (using <code>ng-controller</code>) to elements inside the scope of another controller.
		The controller attached to the child element is known as the 'child controller',
		while the controller attached to the parent element is known as the 'parent controller'. (Surprised?)
		<br/><br/>
		Recall that every controller has its own <code>$scope</code>,
		and properties defined on the <code>$scope</code> can be referenced in HTML, but <i>only</i> inside the controller's element.
		Thus, since a child controller's element is completely contained inside of the parent's element,
		it makes perfect sense that you can reference the parent's <code>$scope</code> properties from inside the child element in HTML,
		and that you cannot reference the child's <code>$scope</code> properties from inside the parent but outside the child.
		<br/><br/>
		This relationship extends to Javascript as well, in what we call Scope Inheritance:
		the parent's <code>$scope</code> properties are 'inherited' by the child controller.
		That means that if the parent has <code>$scope.my_variable</code> defined,
		the child will also have <code>$scope.my_variable</code> defined,
		and any changes that the parent makes to this variable will be immediately reflected in the child's variable.
		The reverse, of course, is NOT true: the parent controller has no knowledge whatsoever of the child's <code>$scope</code> properties;
		it cannot alter or even see them.
		<br/><br/>
		The confusing part comes when you try to alter a parent's <code>$scope</code> property from within the child controller.
		Doing so triggers a desynchronization of the two, so that changes made to the property from the parent are no longer reflected in the child.
		This will probably seem strange at first, but it actually makes quite a lot of sense when you think about the nested nature of HTML.
		<br/><br/>
		This desynchronization behavior stems from the need for a child to be able to create its own <code>$scope</code> properties
		without worrying about the properties of its parents.
		When you sit down to write a controller, you should be able to define <code>$scope.my_variable</code> to whatever you like.
		The possibility that some other coder on your team may have also defined <code>$scope.my_variable</code> in their own controller,
		which happens to be, say, the great-grandparent of your controller, should not prevent you from using that variable name.
		<br/><br/>
		Angular solves this through desynchronization: children inherit the properties of their parents,
		but the moment a child controller changes such a property, it gets its own, separate version of it.
		That way, child controllers can't break parent controllers by accidentally messing with their <code>$scope</code>.
		Be careful, though; once desynchronized, there's no going back.
		The child no longer has any knowledge of the parent's version of the variable.
		<br/><br/>
		Below is an example of scope inheritance and desynchronization.
		
		<div class = 'ang-scope-inheritance-parent' ng-controller='AngScopeInheritanceParentCtrl'>
			This is the parent controller's element.
			<br/><br/>
			<code>$scope.parent_count</code>: {{parent_count}}
			<br/>
			<code>$scope.child_count</code>: {{child_count}} (undefined)
			<br/>
			<div class = 'btn btn-info' ng-click = 'incrementParentCount()'> Add to Parent's counter</div>
			<br/><br/>
			
			<div class = 'ang-scope-inheritance-child' ng-controller='AngScopeInheritanceChildCtrl'>
				This is the child controller's element.
				<br/><br/>
				<code>$scope.parent_count</code>: {{parent_count}}
				<br/>
				<code>$scope.child_count</code>: {{child_count}}
				<br/>
				
				<div class = 'btn btn-info' ng-click = 'incrementParentCount()'> Add to Parent's counter (using Parent's function)</div>
				<div class = 'btn btn-info' ng-click = 'incrementChildCount()'> Add to Child's counter</div>
				<div class = 'btn btn-danger' ng-click = 'incrementBoth()'> Add to Both (using Child's function)</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<br/><br/>
		You may be wondering at this point how a parent can get access to a child's variables, or how a child can alter a parent's variables.
		<a ng-href = '{{appPathLink + "ang-events"}}' target = '_blank'>Event Listeners</a> are usually a good solution for that sort of problem.
