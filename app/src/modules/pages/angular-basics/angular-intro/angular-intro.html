		AngularJS is an advanced Javascript framework, built by people at Google.
		It makes building websites much, much easier;
		in particular, it cuts away much of the difficulty of linking Javascript to HTML with its directives and two-way data binding.
		Angular mostly eliminates the need for Jquery, for those of you who have built websites before.
		<br/><br/>
		Angular is typically used to create <i>single-page apps</i>, which means that the page does not reload when navigating around the site;
		rather, the page's interior content changes, switching between various HTML templates created by you as the browser's url changes.
		Because single-page apps do not need to reload everything with every page change, they tend to be much faster.
		All Mean Seed applications are single-page apps by default.
		<br/><br/>
		There's a lot to Angular, but the most important things to understand are how it uses
		<a ng-href = '{{appPathLink + "ang-scope"}}' target = '_blank'>scope</a>
		to connect an HTML template to a Javascript controller and
		how to use basic <a ng-href = '{{appPathLink + "ang-directives-intro"}}' target = '_blank'>directives</a>.
		With an understanding of those and Javascript, HTML, and CSS,
		you ought to be able to build most of the pieces of an average page.
