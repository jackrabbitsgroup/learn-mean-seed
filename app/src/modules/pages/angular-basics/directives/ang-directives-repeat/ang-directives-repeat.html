		<code>ng-repeat</code> is one of the most useful directives Angular has to offer.
		It also tends to be the most confusing <code>ng-</code> directive for beginners.
		<br/><br/>
		<code>ng-repeat</code> is a bit like an HTML version of a Javascript <code>for</code> loop.
		You give this directive an array, and it creates an HTML element for every entry in the array.
		Here's an example - check this page's Ctrl file to see the array:
		<br/><br/>
		<div class = 'ang-directives-repeat-exam1' ng-repeat = 'item in my_array' style = 'background-color: {{item.bg_color}};'>
			This is item {{$index}}.
			<br/><br/>
			{{item.text}}
		</div>
		<br/>
		<code>ng-repeat</code> creates a copy of the element it is placed on - one copy for every element in the specified array.
		Think of this element as a template: you can put any HTML you like inside it, and it will all be copied faithfully.
		More importantly, you can reference the individual element's information in the template,
		allowing you to make each copy a little bit different.
		<br/><br/>
		In the example above, we use <code>ng-repeat = 'item in my_array'</code>.
		<code>my_array</code> is a Javascript array defined in our Ctrl file.
		It has three elements, each an object with two properties, <code>bg_color</code> and <code>text</code>.
		<code>item</code> is just the variable name we're going to use to reference the current element;
		we could have just as easily said <code>foo in my_array</code>.
		<br/><br/>
		Each repeated element is given its own new <code>$scope</code>, and in this scope,
		<code>item<code> (or <code>foo</code> or whatever the case may be) holds the current element.
		That's why we can reference things like <code>item.bg_color</code> inside the repeated element as if it's a </code>$scope</code> variable.
		<br/><br/>
		<code>ng-repeat</code> also gives us <code>$index</code>, the index of the current element,
		as well as booleans <code>$first</code>, <code>$last</code>, <code>$middle</code>, <code>$even</code>, and <code>$odd</code>.
		These booleans are fairly self-explanatory - <code>$first</code> is true only for the first element,
		<code>$middle</code> is true for all but the first and last elements, <code>$even</code> is true if <code>$index</code> is an even number, and so on.
		<br/><br/>
		As you might have guessed by now, <code>ng-repeat</code> is absurdly useful.
		It allows you to very quickly create a template element, and then all you have to do is fill your array with entries and you'll get a copy of the template for each entry.
		And you can add, edit, or remove entries simply by adjusting the array in Javascript; since it's a <code>$scope</code> variable, everything will update automatically.
		<br/><br/>
		Here's another example for you. Make sure you understand how it works!
		<br/><br/>
		<div class = 'center'>
			<div class = 'ang-directives-repeat-exam2' ng-repeat = 'foo in example_array' ng-click = 'cycleBgColor($index)' style = 'background-color: {{foo.bg_color}};'>
				Click me to change my background color to {{foo.next_color}}
			</div>
			<br/>
			<div class = 'btn btn-info' ng-click = 'addElementToExampleArray()'> Add another element </div>
		</div>

	<h4>Challenges</h4>
		1. Make a list of at least 3 of your favorite movies. Use <code>ng-repeat</code> to display each movie's name, the year it was released,
		and the name of your favorite character in the movie. You may write whatever CSS you wish to format it.<br/>
		2. (Optional Bonus Round) Update your movie repeat code to additionally display an image from each movie that you found online,
		and also display a link to the movie's IMDB or Wikipedia page.
