		Directives are Angular's most powerful tools. They are primarily used to adjust the page's DOM (html), and can accomplish a wide variety of tasks.
		<br/><br/>
		Directives come in many forms. Some are short and simple; others are extremely complex.
		Learning to create your own directives is probably the most difficult thing about learning Angular;
		fortunately, however, learning to use existing directives isn't nearly so difficult.
		<br/><br/>
		Angular comes with a lot of directives built-in, some of which you may have already seen,
		like <code>ng-controller</code>, <code>ng-click</code>, or <code>ng-repeat</code>.
		(All of Angular's default directives are prefixed with <code>ng-</code>.)
		As you might expect from default directives, they cover nearly all basic functionality that you might want,
		and are fairly well documented by <a href = 'http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng#directive'>Angular's API Reference</a>.
		These lessons will cover the more useful directives individually, though.
		<br/><br/>
		Directives are used from HTML. They can be activated as a class name or sometimes even as an element name, but usually they're written as an attribute:
		<br/><br/>
		<code>&lt;div ng-click = 'myFunction()'&gt;</code>
		<br/><br/>
		The code above would activate the <code>ngClick</code> directive on that div element;
		this particular directive attaches a click event to the element in question.
		Every directive is a bit different; the easiest way to learn to use a directive is usually just to see a working example or two.
		Be aware that though directives are always activated from HTML,
		they often depend on <code>$scope</code> variables in Javascript controllers for their input.
		That means that you'll usually need to check both HTML and Javascipt in order to fully understand how a directive is being used.
