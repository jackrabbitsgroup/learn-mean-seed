		Angular's <code>ng-show</code> is a very simple but nevertheless very helpful directive,
		used to conditionally display an element.
		It takes a Javascript expression as its argument that should evaluate to either true or false,
		just like an expression you'd use in an <code>if</code> statement.
		<br/><br/>
		If the expression evaluates to true (or to a "truthy" value), the element will be displayed.
		If the expression evaluates to false (or to a "falsy" value), the element will be hidden.
		<br/><br/>
		<code>ng-hide</code> works exactly the same way as <code>ng-show</code>, except the roles of true and false are reversed:
		true values hide the element, false values show it.
		It exists purely for your convenience;
		everything that can be done with <code>ng-hide</code> can easily be done with <code>ng-show</code> as well.
		<br/><br/>
		<code>ng-if</code> is almost identical to <code>ng-show</code>, but it differs in one very important aspect:
		when <code>ng-show</code> receives a false expression, it hides the element using the CSS code <code>display: none</code>,
		causing the element to disappear as far as the user is concerned.
		<code>ng-if</code> however, does not merely hide elements; it obliterates them.
		<br/><br/>
		When <code>ng-if</code> receives a false expression, it removes the element from the page entirely.
		The element is not even rendered at all - you won't even see it in your web inspector, because it no longer exists.
		This means that if you want to re-show an element "hidden" by <code>ng-if</code>, then the browser must completely
		re-render the element and everything in it, which is inefficient.
		On the other hand, the browser will not bother to render elements "hidden" by <code>ng-if</code>,
		which is more efficient if you know that that particular element is unlikely to be displayed (or should never be displayed) to your current user.
		<br/><br/>
		Summary: Use <code>ng-show</code> (or <code>ng-hide</code>) for things that are likely to be frequently toggled between shown and hidden.
		Use <code>ng-if</code> for things that are never toggled or are toggled very infrequently.
		<br/><br/>
		Here are some examples:
		<br/><br/>
		<div class = 'btn btn-primary' ng-show = 'button1_show' ng-click = 'button1_show = false'>Click me to show orange and red buttons.</div>
		<div class = 'btn btn-warning' ng-show = '!button1_show' ng-click = 'button1_show = true'>Click me to go back to the blue button.</div>
		<div class = 'btn btn-danger' ng-hide = 'button1_show' ng-click = 'counter = counter + 1'>Click me to increase $scope.counter.</div>
		<br/><br/>
		<div class = 'btn btn-info' ng-if = 'counter > 3 && counter < 7' ng-click = 'resetCounter()' > Click to reset $scope.counter to 0. (This div exists only when the counter is more than 3 and less than 7)</div>
		<br/><br/>
		Current value of $scope.counter: {{counter}}.
