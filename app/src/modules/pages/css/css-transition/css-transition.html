		The <code>transition</code> property is used to smoothly adjust another CSS property from one value to another.
		Though this can be done with virtually any property, it only truly makes sense with properties that can have intermediate values,
		such as width and height (or anything else with a numerical value, for that matter), and also colors.
		<br/><br/>
		<code>transition</code>, as of 2013, is still a <a ng-href = '{{appPathLink + "css-vendor-prefix"}}' target = '_blank'>vendor-prefixed property</a>.
		Thus, in Mean Seed, we use a <a ng-href = '{{appPathLink + "css-mixin"}}' target = '_blank'>mixin</a> to create transition effects.
		The LESS version of this mixin (which is aptly named 'transition') looks like this:
		<br/><br/>
		<code>.transition(background-color 2s ease 1s);</code>
		<br/><br/>
		The first input is the property to be transitioned (you can use <code>all</code> to have the transition apply to everything).<br/>
		The second input is the transition duration - the amount of time it takes for the property to transition from its old value to its new value.<br/>
		The third input is a timing function, which has to do with the transition's speed.
		<code>ease</code> and <code>linear</code> should cover almost all your needs here;
		<a ng-href = 'http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_transition-timing-function.asp'>W3Schools</a> can tell you more if that's not enough.<br/>
		The fourth input is the delay - the time between when the transition is triggered and when it actually begins.
		<br/><br/>
		To create a transition effect, first apply the mixin to the element in question.
		Now the browser will 'watch' the specified property on that element; whenever the value of the property changes, the transition will kick in.
		Changing the property value is typically done by adjusting the element's classes somehow, which usually requires Javascript.
		It can also be done with pure CSS using the <a ng-href = '{{appPathLink + "css-pclasses-hover"}}' target = '_blank'>hover pseudo-class</a>.
		Here are some examples:
		<br/><br/>
		<div class = 'css-transition-example1'> Hover here!<br/><code>.transition(all 5s ease 1s);</code></div>
		<br/>
		<!-- This next example uses Javascript with Angular to change the class whenever the div is clicked -->
		<div class = 'css-transition-example2 {{click_class}}' ng-click = 'changeClass()'>
			Click here, several times!<br/>
			<code>.transition(all 1s linear 0s);</code><br/>
			Current class: {{click_class}}
		</div>
