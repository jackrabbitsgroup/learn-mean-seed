		Styling text with CSS is fairly simple and straightforward, for the most part.
		Once again, W3Schools has a useful reference of <a href = 'http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_text.asp' target = '_blank'>Text Styles</a>
		and <a href = 'http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_font.asp' target = '_blank'>Font Styles</a>, and honestly, those pages alone can tell you pretty much everything you need to know.
		<br/><br/>
		I won't bother repeating what W3Schools has laid out so nicely, but I will say that you don't need to memorize every single property.
		Just make sure that you understand <code>color</code>, <code>text-align</code>, <code>font-size</code>, <code>line-height</code>, and <code>font-family</code>.
		<code>text-decoration</code>, <code>font-style</code>, and <code>font-weight</code> are less important, but still good to know.
		You probably won't use the others very often; just know that they exist, and you can look them up if you ever need them.
		<br/><br/>
		Most of the styles above are fairly self-explanatory, but I would like to point out a particular use for <code>line-height</code> that is often especially helpful: vertical centering.
		<br/><br/>
		Horizontally centering text inside a large div is easy with <code>text-align: center;</code>, but vertical centering is notoriously troublesome in comparison.
		You might think that the <code>vertical-align</code> property would handle it easily, but you'd be wrong. That property almost never works like you want it to where centering is concerned.
		<br/><br/>
		The <code>line-height</code> property is perfect for centering if you know the height of your container and if your text only spans a single line.
		That might sound like a very limited scenario, but it's actually very common - most buttons, for example, satisfy these conditions.
		So, if those two conditions hold, you can just set <code>line-height</code> equal to the height of your container, and you're done.
		This is usually much quicker, easier, and less likely to break than any other alternative.
