		The descendant selector allows you to target child elements of a particular parent. Syntactically, it is very simple;
		just write a selector for the parent element followed by a selector for the child, with a space between, as in <code>.parent .child</code>.
		In this example, the selector targets elements with the class <code>child</code>, but <i>only</i> if they are also inside an element with the class <code>parent</code>.
		<br/><br/>
		<div class = 'css-descendant-child'>This element is not in the 'parent', so the descendant selector does not apply.</div>
		<br/>
		<div class = 'css-descendant-parent'>
			<div class = 'css-descendant-child'>This element is in the 'parent', so the descendant selector does apply.</div>
		</div>
		<br/><br/>
		You can chain this selector together as well, as in <code>.ancestor .parent .child</code>,
		in order to target only <code>.child</code>ren that are descendants of <code>.parent</code>s that are descendants of <code>.ancestor</code>s.
		You can do this as many times as you like, but if you find yourself chaining often or many times, you should probably reevaluate your strategy.
		<br/><br/>
		Side note: There is also the child selector <code>></code>, as in <code>.parent > .child</code>. This works just like the descendant selector,
		except it targets only immediate children rather than any descendant of <code>.parent</code>.
		<br/><br/>
		The descendant selector can be very helpful, but it can also become annoying and difficult to keep track of if used too often.
		Thus, it should be used only when necessary.
		Do <b>NOT</b> use a descendant selector simply because you were too lazy to write a new class for the element you want to style!
		Rather, save it for a situation where you have no easier way to distinguish two elements than by their parents.
		<br/><br/>
		You will probably find that you almost never need to use the descendant selector, but on those rare occasions when you do, it can save you from a massive headache.
