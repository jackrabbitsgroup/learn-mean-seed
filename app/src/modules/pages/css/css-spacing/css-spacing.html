		Adding spacing between elements is one of the most common tasks in CSS, and luckily for us, it's not difficult.
		The three relevant properties are <code>margin</code>, <code>border</code>, and <code>padding</code>.
		<br/><br/>
		You already know what a border is - it surrounds the outside of an element, usually as a thin, solid line.
		Margin is the space on the outside of the border, separating the border from any elements surrouding our element.
		Padding is the space on the inside of the border, separating the border from the interior of the element.
		This image says it all:
		<br/><br/>
		<img ng-src = '{{appPathImg + "box-model.png"}}' />
		<br/><br/>
		Each of these properties has four sides: <code>top</code>, <code>bottom</code>, <code>left</code>, and <code>right</code>.
		You can define all four at once with something like <code>padding: 10px;</code>,
		or you can specify each individually using <code>margin-top</code>, <code>margin-left</code>, etc.
		<br/><br/>
		Here are some example divs. They all have the same <code>height</code> and <code>width</code>.
		<br/><br/>
		<div class = 'css-spacing-example1'> Padding </div>
		<div class = 'css-spacing-example2'> Margin </div>
		<div class = 'css-spacing-example3'> Margin, padding, and border</div>
		<div class = 'css-spacing-example4'> Dashed Border, large left padding only, no margin</div>
		<div class = 'css-spacing-example5'> Top margin, huge right border, thin top border </div>
		<div class = 'css-spacing-example6'> Top padding, left margin, dotted border </div>
		<br/><br/>
		Margin*, padding, and border width** are valued in <code>px</code> (pixels) or as a % of the available width.
		Be warned that %s do not work well, if at all, with regards to height;
		do not rely on % values when specifying <code>height</code>s, <code>top</code>s, <code>bottom</code>s, or any another vertical property, for that matter.
		They almost never behave as you would expect.
		<br/><br/>
		<div class = 'css-spacing-marginauto'>
			*There is another value for margins that can be very useful:
			setting <code>margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;</code> will center the element horizontally in the available space.
			Try resizing your window - this div will stay centered.
			This does not work vertically, though, for the same reason that % values do not work well with heights - browsers are notoriously bad at that sort of thing.
		</div>
		<br/><br/>
		**I said 'border width' because the <code>border</code> property is actually a combination of three properties:
		<code>border-width</code>, <code>border-style</code>, and <code>border-color</code>.
		That's why border values have three parts, as in <code>border: 1px solid black</code>.
		The order in which you write these parts does not matter.
