		Selectors in CSS serve as the link between style rules and HTML elements.
		Elements identified (or 'selected') by the selector will beb given the styles associated with that selector.
		<br/><br/>
		There are dozens of ways to write a selector; they can become extremely complicated.
		Fortunately, however, they typically don't need to be, and good coders will often see to it that their selectors remain as simple as possible.
		<br/><br/>
		The most common selector by far is the class selector, which you can and should use for almost all of your CSS needs.
		It is flexible and easy to use: simply assign a class name to your element, and then write a CSS rule under that class name, like so:
		<br/><br/>
		HTML:<br/>
		<code> &lt;div class = "selector-demo" &gt; My Test Div &lt;/div&gt; </code>
		<br/><br/>
		CSS: <br/>
		<code>
		.selector-demo<br/>
			{<br/>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color: red;<br/>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;padding: 5px;<br/>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;border: solid 1px gray;<br/>
			}
		</code>
		<br/><br/>
		The code above produces this result:
		<br/><br/>
		<div class = 'selector-demo'> My Test Div </div>
		<br/>
		The <code>.</code> in the CSS is the class selector; it tells the browser that what follows (in this case, <code>selector-demo</code>) is a class name that it should search for.
		With this CSS rule in effect, any element on the page with the class <code>selector-demo</code> will have red color text, 5 pixels of padding on all four sides, and a simple gray border.
		<br/><br/>
		You can also create a selector that targets multiple classes at once by simply writing two selectors at once, with no spaces between: <code>.selector-demo.selector-example</code> .
		This selector would only apply to elements that have <b>both</b> of those classes.
		<br/><br/>
		If you want the same style rule to apply to multiple selectors, you can use a comma-separated list: <code>.selector-demo, .selector-example</code> .
		This selector would apply to elements that have at least one of those two classes.
		<br/><br/>
		As mentioned before, the class selector is all you need in almost all practical cases, especially in Mean Seed.
		Nevertheless, you should also know about the id selector, <code>#</code>.
		It works just like the class selector, but it targets an element's <code>id</code> attribute instead the <code>class</code> attribute,
		and it uses a <code>#</code> in place of the class selector's <code>.</code> symbol.
		<br/><br/>
		You can also write selectors to target element types by simply writing the element itself, as in
		<br/><br/>
		<code>
		div<br/>
			{<br/>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color: blue;<br/>
			}
		</code>
		<br/><br/>
		The CSS above would be applied to ALL <code>div</code> elements, though, which usually isn't something you want to do.
		Generally speaking, you want your CSS selectors to be as specific as possible, so as not to interfere with any other elements on your website.
		<br/><br/>
		There are a few other kinds of selectors, most notably the <a ng-href = '{{appPathLink + "css-descendant"}}' target = '_blank'>descendant selector</a>
		and the various 'pseudo-selectors', like <code>:hover</code> or <code>:first-child</code>, but those are topics for another lesson.
		<br/><br/>		
		W3Schools has a <a href = 'http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp' target = '_blank'>CSS Selector Reference</a> which should be useful if you ever encounter a selector you don't recognize.
