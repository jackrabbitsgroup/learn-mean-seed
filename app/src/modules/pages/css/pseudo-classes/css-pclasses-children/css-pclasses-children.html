		The <code>:first-child</code>, <code>:last-child</code>, and <code>:nth-child</code> selectors are used to target elements based on their order inside their parent element.
		As you would expect, <code>:first-child</code> will only apply to an element if it is the first element inside its parent, <code>:last-child</code> will only apply to the
		last element, and <code>:nth-child</code> can be used to target any child (or group of children).
		<br/><br/>
		These selectors are most commonly used with lists, where you will frequently want to style to first or last element in the list slightly differently -
		for example, the first element in a vertically-oriented list might not need a <code>margin-top</code> for spacing purposes, but all the rest do.
		<code>:first-child</code> and <code>:last-child</code> spare you the trouble of giving the first or last elements a different or extra class.
		(This is particularly useful in conjunction with Angular's <code>ng-repeat</code>.)
		<br/><br/>
		<code>:nth-child</code> is a bit more complicated. It can be used to target a specific child with something like <code>.example-class:nth-child(4)</code>,
		which would apply to elements with the class <code>.example-class</code> only if the element is the fourth child of its parent.
		This type of usage is fairly simple and straightforward.
		<br/><br/>
		<code>:nth-child</code> can do more, however. Instead of specifying a particular number like 4, you could write a rule to target a whole set of elements.
		For example, <code>.example-class:nth-child(2n+1)</code> would target all odd-numbered children,
		<code>.example-class:nth-child(4n+3)</code> would target elements 3, 7, 11, 15, and so on.
		Needless to say, this kind of versatility can make the <code>:nth-child</code> selector extremely useful in certain situations.
		In practice, however, you'll most likely rarely need to do more than target every other element, and even that isn't all that common, unfortunately.
		<br/><br/>
		Here's an example of these selectors in action. This is also a working example of <code>ng-repeat</code>, in case you're interested.
		<br/><br/>
		<div>
			<div class = 'css-pclasses-children-demo' ng-repeat = 'element in my_child_elements'> {{element.element_text}} </div>
		</div>
		<br/><br/>
		Be careful of precedence when using these selectors together; if you have a <code>:first-child</code> and <code>:nth-child</code> selector that target the same element,
		(or any two <code>-child</code> selectors targeting the same element, for that matter),
		then the one that appears last in the CSS file will take precedence, overwriting any CSS properties defined by both of them.
		<br/><br/>
		You should also be aware of the <code>:first-of-type</code>, <code>:last-of-type</code>, and <code>:nth-of-type</code> selectors.
		These work exactly like the analagous <code>-child</code> selectors, except that that target elements based on their type as well as their position.
		For example, where <code>.example-class:first-child</code> targets elements that have the class <code>.example-class</code> and are also the first child of their parent,
		<code>.example-class:first-of-type</code> targets elements that are the first occurrence of the class <code>.example-class</code> in their parent,
		regardless of how many other sibling elements may have come before it.
