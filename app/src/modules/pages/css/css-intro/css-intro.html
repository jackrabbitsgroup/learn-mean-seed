		CSS stands for 'Cascading Style Sheets', and its primary purpose is to make your webpage look prettier.
		CSS often plays a large role in the positioning of elements of your page, and is also used to adjust things like colors, borders, spacing, and sizing.
		It can even be used to add some limited functionality to your page using things like <a ng-href = '{{appPathLink + "css-transition"}}' target = '_blank'>transitions</a> or <a ng-href = '{{appPathLink + "css-pclasses-hover"}}' target = '_blank'>hover events</a>.
		<br/><br/>
		CSS is written by assigning 'values' to 'properties' under a given 'selector'. The syntax looks like this:
		<br/><br/>
		<code>
			selector1<br/>
			{<br/>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;property1: value1;<br/>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;property2: value2;<br/>
			}
			<br/><br/>			
			selector2<br/>
			{<br/>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;property3: value3;<br/>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;property4: value4;<br/>
			}
		</code>
		<br/><br/>
		<a ng-href = '{{appPathLink + "css-selectors"}}' target = '_blank'>Selectors</a> come in many forms, but their purpose is always to identify some element on the page.
		Any elements that are identified by a given selector will be assigned the styles specified by the properties and values attached to that selector.
		This group of styles attached to the selector is sometimes called the selector's 'rule'.
		<br/><br/>
		There are many CSS properties to choose from, and each one has its own set of possible values.
		This can make learning CSS seem a bit daunting at first, but you'll quickly learn all of the common properties and values in the other CSS lessons,
		and the internet can tell you about any others you have questions about.
		The <a href = 'http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/' target = '_blank'>CSS Reference at W3Schools</a> is particularly helpful here.
		<br/><br/>
		One last thing to note: In Mean Seed, we use a CSS preprocessor - either LESS or SCSS (but not both on the same project) - instead of straight CSS.
		That means that if you're trying to write CSS in Mean Seed, you should be editing a file with a <code>.less</code> or <code>.scss</code> extension.
		You don't need to understand LESS or SCSS just yet, though; for now, just know that anything that works in normal CSS will work just the same in LESS or SCSS.
