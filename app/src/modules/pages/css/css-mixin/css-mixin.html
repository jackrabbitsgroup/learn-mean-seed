		Mixins are not a part of standard CSS; they are an additional feature provided by the CSS preprocessors, LESS and SCSS.
		At their simplest, mixins are just groups of CSS lines that you can quickly insert anywhere in your CSS.
		(More complex mixins can also accept inputs and essentially serve as CSS functions, but you probably won't need to worry about those often.)
		<br/><br/>
		In LESS, every class is a mixin. Simply reference the name of a class inside a CSS rule, and the CSS lines listed under that class will be duplicated in the rule.
		See this page's <code>.less</code> file for examples.
		<br/><br/>
		This website uses LESS, not SCSS, so I can't provide a working example of SCSS mixins here, but I can describe the syntax.
		In SCSS, mixins are created using <code>@mixin</code> and used with <code>@include</code> as follows:<br/><br/>
		<code>
			@mixin my-mixin<br/>
			{<br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color: black;<br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;border: solid 1px black;<br/>
			}<br/>
			.example-class<br/>
			{<br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@include my-mixin;<br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Additional styles here]<br/>
			}
		</code>
		<br/><br/>
		In the example above, when the SCSS is compiled into CSS (which is one of the many tasks performed by <code>grunt</code> in Mean Seed),
		the CSS rule for example-class would be<br/><br/>
		<code>
			.example-class<br/>
			{<br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color: black;<br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;border: solid 1px black;<br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Additional styles here]<br/>
			}
		</code>
		<br/><br/>
		LESS mixins work exactly the same way - they are compiled into CSS by <code>grunt</code>, with the mixin's styles inserted where specified.
		<br/><br/>
		Mixins can be extremely useful for keeping your CSS in sync. They allow you to place the same CSS into multiple class rules,
		and you can later change that CSS for all of those classes with ease by simply editing the mixin.
		Mixins with inputs are also very helpful for handling <a ng-href = '{{appPathLink + "css-vendor-prefix"}}' target = '_blank'>vendor-prefixed properties</a>.
		(Most such mixins have already been written for you in Mean Seed, by the way).

			These two divs have different classes,
		</div>
		<div class = 'css-mixin-example2'>
			but some of their properties are kept in sync with a mixin.
