# Setup (More Detailed Version)

### Setup
1. [ONCE PER MACHINE/ENVIRONMENT] machine (global / program) installs
	1. Install git, nodejs, mongodb, and phantomjs
		1. See other README's (i.e. [server-mac.md](server-mac.md) or [server-windows.md](server-windows.md) or [server-linux.md](server-linux.md)) or just google search for steps on how to do this.
		2. Configure git (required for pushing and pulling)
			1. `git config --global user.name "<your name>"`
				1. i.e. git config --global user.name "Joe Bob"
			2. `git config --global user.email "<your email>"`
				1. i.e. git config --global user.email youremail@email.com
			3. `git config --global --add color.ui true`
	2. Install global NPM packages.
		1. `sudo npm install -g grunt-cli bower yo karma yuidocjs forever generator-mean-seed less`
			1. NOTE: karma doesn't seem to always work if install globally?? so it's in package.json now so will be installed locally (as well)
		2. NOTE: IF new global npm packages are installed, you'll need to run this again.
	3. Install Selenium server (for local Protractor tests, if using SauceLabs or another remote server, this can be skipped. Also NOTE this must be done AFTER `npm install` below since it requires Protractor first)
		1. `./node_modules/protractor/bin/install_selenium_standalone`

2. Create a new directory where you want your app to be and then navigate to it (with `cd`) and run yeoman generator with `yo mean-seed`
	1. NOTE: if you're cloning / copying an EXISTING code repository, see [cloning.md](cloning.md) instead!
	2. You can skip the prompts if you want by using a JSON config file. To do so, create a `yo-configs` folder and add a JSON file to it with the answers to the prompts (see or copy a file in the `yo-configs` folder from here for reference: https://github.com/jackrabbitsgroup/generator-mean-seed ).
		1. To copy from the global generator-mean-seed install (and edit on command line - i.e. with `sudo vi default.json`) use `cp [path to generator-mean-seed]/yo-configs/default.json yo-configs/default.json` and then edit is as needed.
		2. To edit locally and then copy remotely to your server use `scp default.json [user]@[remote host ip/domain]:/[path to new app]/yo-configs/default.json`

3. Install nodejs and bower dependencies using `npm` and `bower`. This only needs to be done once initially, but must be re-run every time package.json is updated. When in doubt, run `npm install && bower install` from your project root since you can't run it too much (if you run it extra times it won't do anything).
```bash
cd /path/to/project
npm install && bower install
```
	1. NOTE: If you get an EACCESS error on `npm install`, try it with `sudo` in front..
	2. NOTE: If you are on Windows and get a bson error (or any errors, for that matter), try it with Cygwin. Sometimes it doesn't work on Git Bash, but it will on Cygwin due to permissions issues. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14100027/cant-install-js-bson for more information.

4. [OPTIONAL] Use a different / non-default config.json file
	1. All the config.json files for ALL environments should be in version control in the `app/configs` folder. To determine which file is used, the `config_environment.json` file is checked and IF it exists AND the `environment` key exists, that environment will be used. The naming conventions are: `config-[your environment].json` for the config (i.e. `config-triggerio.json`) and `config-[your environment].test.json` for the accompanying test config (for running tests, which should run on a DIFFERENT, dummy database as it will be wiped clean each time!). So if you want to use the non-default environment, do the steps below:
	2. FYI, the config.json file is used in the following files:
		1. Gruntfile.js
		2. run.js
		3. app/test/apiTestHelpers.js
	3. More info on configs: see [configs.md](../files/configs.md)
```bash
# cd to root project directory
cd /path/to/project
# copy the config_environment.json file and set the `environment` key to your new environment.
cp app/config_environment.json config_environment.json
# Copy then EDIT your new config file
cp app/config.json app/config-[your environment].json
# Copy then EDIT your new config file for its test configuration (for backend tests)
cp app/config-[your environment].json app/config-[your environment].test.json
# Update your new, copied test config for the test environment - specifically, change 'db.database' and 'session.store.db' to a different testing database, such as 'test_temp'. Also, optionally, change the `server.port` so that way both the test server and the non-test server can run at the same time.
```

5. [OPTIONAL] Git add remote (should have already been git init'ed and commit'ed automatically)
	1. (optional) add a remote: `git remote add origin [url to repository]`
